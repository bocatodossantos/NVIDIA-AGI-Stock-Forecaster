A sophisticated forecasting model for NVIDIA stock that incorporates AGI timeline estimates and AI landscape analysis. This project uses machine learning and probabilistic modeling to forecast NVIDIA's stock performance based on traditional market factors alongside AGI development timelines.

## Features

- Historical NVIDIA stock data analysis with technical indicators
- AGI timeline probability modeling using expert surveys and compute scaling laws
- Integration with Anthropic's Claude API for AI landscape analysis
- Machine learning forecasting with AGI-aware adjustments
- Monte Carlo simulations for confidence intervals
- Visualization of forecasts, AGI probabilities, and scenario analysis

## Why This Matters

NVIDIA's future is closely tied to AI development trajectories. Traditional stock forecasting models don't adequately account for the potential impact of AGI breakthroughs. This project attempts to quantify these effects using:

- Expert AGI timeline forecasts
- Compute scaling trends
- AI research developments
- Market sentiment analysis

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NVIDIA-AGI-Stock-Forecaster.git
cd NVIDIA-AGI-Stock-Forecaster

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and edit config file
cp config/api_config.yaml.example config/api_config.yaml
# Add your API keys to config/api_config.yaml
```

## Quick Start

```python
from src.models.stock_forecast import NvidiaStockForecast

# Initialize the forecaster
forecaster = NvidiaStockForecast()

# Load data and run analysis
forecaster.fetch_stock_data(years=5)
forecaster.analyze_ai_landscape()

# Train model and generate forecast
forecaster.train_model()
forecast = forecaster.forecast_future(days=365)

# Visualize results
forecaster.plot_forecast(forecast)
```
